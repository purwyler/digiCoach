## Summary
DigiCoach provides a *Tele-coach* system for empowering diabetes self-management, while addressing the **patient data interoperability**. It provides an App that makes it easy for them to collect information related to their health and condition. The patient can choose which information gets shared in a secure way with a health coach of their choice. With this information, the coach can support the patient better and remotely, with consultations being managed from within the application

## The Challenge
It address the challenge providing the following features 1) acts as a nudge nurse to provide reminders for medications, 2) provides data visualisation from the wearable sensors, 3) collects food information from various inputs 4) maintains wellbeing status through simple question and answers.

We envision a holistic approach with a 360Â° view of the patient, helping the patient in his journey to make conscious life style choices, provide easy access to his health data and maintain a healthy social life.

## Patient champion interaction
Patient Champion [E.E](https://2020.healthhack.solutions/project/24) 
Champion E.E provided us with his medical experience and helped us to define the relevant features of digiCoach. Existing applications offer some of the features, but there is no existing solution that combines the desired features in one applications, and that can import the quantitative data automatically.

External Patient Champion (female) from Central Switzerland provided their user needs and experiences.

## Description of the solution:
*What is the approach? What does it do? How does it work? Which resources does it require? What are the benefits? And who benefits from our solution?*
Digicoach is a app, for mobile/website. It allows to collect both quantative health data from measuring devices like blood sugar, sleep and activity data as well as keeping record of qualitative measures of well being entered by the user, like mood, energy and stress level. This information is shared with a trusted health coach, so that this person can give accurate and personalized support to the patient. The benefits for the patient are that they have one central tool to collect the data that is relevant to get accurate and timely advice. If the coach can have easy access to the information and can easily schedule remote consultations, they can work more efficiently, allowing them to work with more patients.
